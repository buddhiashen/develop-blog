## What exactly is indeed an Email Slicer?

Email Slicer is simply a program that requires an email id as input and performs slicing processes on it to return the username and domain of the email id.

### As an example:
#### input: 

```shell
buddhiict@gmail.com
```

#### Output:
```shell
Email slicer by Buddhi ashen
username stand for the Your username based on the given email address.
domain means the '@gmail.com' or '@yahoo.com' or @outlook.com' based on the given email address .
to proceed simply enter 'yes' or 'y
to exit the programme simply enter 'no' or 'n'
proceed to programme Y/N : y
<<<<<<< E-mail slicer >>>>>>>>
Want to proceed Y/N : y
Enter an email to slice : buddiict@gmail.com
--------------------------------
<-- username = buddiict -->
<-- domian = '@' gmail.com -->
________________________________
<<<<<<< E-mail slicer >>>>>>>>
```

Here we got ```buddhiict``` as username and ```gmail.com``` as a domain.

This project is super simple and quick and it doesn't require any setup so let's quickly jump to coding and build this.

## Let's Code
So this first we are going to do is to ask the user to enter the email to be sliced.

```python
email = input("Enter Your Email: ").strip()
```
in here we create a variable called ```email```. after that we get a user input by using ```input``` tag. by using ```strip()``` we can remove any additional & unwanted spacing on both sides of string.

## Let's move to the next step now.

```python
username = email[:email.index('@')]
domain = email[email.index('@') + 1:]
```
Here we are slicing the user input to obtain the username and domain and ignore the rest.
Let's see how it works.

In case of ```username``` variable we only want to keep the part of the string which comes before ```@``` and ignore the rest.

Here we are making use of slicing operator ```:``` and ```index()``` function. ```index()``` function searches for the particular element or character within the string and lists it is associated with and return its index number.

Let's consider the input is ```buddhiict@gmail.com```, so when we write ```email[:email.index('@')]```i, our ```index()``` function will interpret it as email[:13] as our @ is located at index 13. Now email[:13] knows that @ is located at index 13, so now it will keep the part before index 13 and discard the rest.

This exact same process is followed for ```domain``` also.


And now finally, let's print our output.

```python
print(f"Your username is {username} & domain is {domain}")
```
We are making use of ```f-string```, a ```new addition to Python 3``` which allows us to directly place our variables in the output string. Feel free to make use of ```format()``` or old school ```+``` or ```,``` operators if you don't want to use ```f-string```.
